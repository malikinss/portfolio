TODO:
        Let's assume that the playing field for darts is a square matrix.
        That filled with natural numbers arranged in ascending order
        from the edges to the center.

        The side of the playing field is the side of the square matrix
        that this field represents.

        Write a program that creates a darts field of a certain size.

        It's guaranteed that the side of the playing field does'nt exceed 18.

        Input:
            The program receives a single natural number as input â€” the
            side of the playing field.

        Output:
            The program must create and output a playing field with a
            given side.
