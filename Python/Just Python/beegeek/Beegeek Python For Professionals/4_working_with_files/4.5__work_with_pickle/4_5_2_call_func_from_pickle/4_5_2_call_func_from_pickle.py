TODO:
        A pickle file containing a single serialized function is given.

        Write a program that calls this function with the given arguments and
        prints the return value of the function.

        The program receives the name of the pickle file containing the single
        serialized function as its first input line.

        Then an arbitrary number of lines are passed, each containing a
        positional argument for this function.

        The program must call the function from the specified pickle file with
        all the string arguments entered, and print the return value of
        the function.

        The arguments must be passed in the order in which they were entered.

NOTE:
        The arguments passed to the function must be of type str.

        Let's look at the first test.

        First, the name of the file is passed â€” func.pkl, which contains the
        serialized function:
            def func(*args):
            return ' '.join(args)
        then the arguments for this function:
            Hello,, how, are, you and today?.

        The program prints the result of the following call:
            func('Hello,', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'today?')

        To read an arbitrary number of lines, use the sys.stdin stream input.

        Assume that the input file is in the program folder.

        This task implements two functions behind the scenes, named func
        and add.

        Do not use these names for your variables to avoid errors.
