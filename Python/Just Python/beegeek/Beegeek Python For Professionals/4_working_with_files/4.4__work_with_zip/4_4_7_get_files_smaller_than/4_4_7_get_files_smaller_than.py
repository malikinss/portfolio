TODO:
        You have access to a set of different files, the names of which are
        presented in the file_names list.

        You can also access the files.zip archive.

        Complete the code below so that it adds to the files.zip archive only
        those files from the file_names list whose size doesn't
        exceed 100 bytes.

NOTE:
        You can get the file size in bytes using the getsize() function from
        the os.path module.

        This function takes the path to the file as an argument and returns
        the size of the specified file in bytes.

        For example, you can calculate the size of the files.zip archive in
        bytes and save it in the size variable as follows:
            import os.path
            size = os.path.getsize('files.zip')

        You can also calculate the file size in bytes manually, without
        resorting to third-party modules.
        Think about it ðŸ˜‰.

        Assume that the files from the file_names list and the files.zip
        archive are in the program folder.
