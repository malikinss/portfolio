TODO:
        Consider two lists:
            messages = ['Hi, Linda', 'Hi, Sam', 'How are you doing?']
            senders = ['Sam Fisher', 'Linda', 'Sam Fisher']

        The first list represents a set of sent messages in some messenger,
        the second list is a set of senders of these messages.

        And the message messages[i] was sent by the user senders[i].

        Each message is a sequence of words separated by a space (punctuation
        marks are considered parts of words).

        The number of words is the total number of words sent by the user.

        Note that each user can send more than one message.

        For example, the user Sam Fisher sent 2 words in the first message and
        4 words in the second, therefore, his number of words is 2+4=6.

        Implement a function best_sender() that takes two arguments in
        the following order:
            messages â€” a list of messages
            senders â€” a list of sender names

        The function should determine the sender with the largest number of
        words and return its name.

        If there are multiple such senders, the name of the one whose name is
        greater in a lexicographic comparison should be returned.

NOTE:
        It is guaranteed that the lengths of the lists passed to the function
        are the same.
