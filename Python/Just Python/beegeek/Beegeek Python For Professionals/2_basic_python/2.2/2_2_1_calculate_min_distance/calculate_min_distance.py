TODO:   
        Today Timur is waiting for his friend Arthur to visit him to plan work on the new course "OOP in Python". 

        To prepare for the meeting, Timur needs to visit two shops located near his house. 

        There is a d1 meter long path leading from the house to the first store, and a d2 meter long path leads to the second store. 

        There is also a path connecting the two shops to each other, d3 meters long.

        Write a program that calculates the minimum distance Timur will need to walk to visit both stores and return home. 
        
        Timur always starts from home. 

        He must visit both stores, moving only along the available three paths, and return home. 

        At the same time, it will not bother him at all if he has to visit the same store or walk along the same path more than once. 

        His only task is to minimize the total distance traveled.

NOTE:   
        The program is supplied with 3 natural numbers â€” the lengths of the tracks, each on a separate line:

            d1 is the length of the track connecting Timur's house and the first store
            d2 is the length of the track connecting Timur's house and the second store
            d3 is the length of the track connecting the shops
