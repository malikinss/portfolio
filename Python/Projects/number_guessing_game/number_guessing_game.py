'''
Project Description: The program generates a random number in the range from 1 to 100 and asks the user to guess this number.

If the user's guess is greater than a random number, the program should display the message 'Too high, try again'.

If the guess is less than the random number, the program should display the message 'Too low, try again'.

If the user guesses the number, the program should congratulate him and display the message 'You guessed it, congratulations!'.

Project components:

Integers (type int);
Variables;
Data input/output (input() and print() functions);
Conditional statement (if/elif/else);
while loop;
Endless cycle;
Operators break, continue;
Working with the random module to generate random numbers.
